Simple Responsive Slider, is a jquery slider which implements responsiveSlides, from (responsiveslides.com). It also uses CodeMirror (codemirror.net) for the editor. CodeMirror, is provided only with css mode, and not with the full range, of syntax highlighting.

The plugin implements the most of the features of the slider, which can be controled from the plugin admin panel. These options are: autoplay, random play, 

timeout between next fade,  pause, speed of fade effect, pause controls, pager, text of previous and next control, namespace, pagination and also includes 

the slider Id textfield, which gives the ability to have multiple sliders in the same page. Each slider has its own options and configuration.

In the admin panel, there is the possibility to upload 5 images, using the wordpress image uploader, and if the pagination is enabled, to write the caption for each image.

The editor provided, uses codemirror for syntax highlighting, and there is also the possibility to change its theme, using the themes files provided from codemirror. 

Each slider, is saved as a custom post type (named Responsive Slider), and is provided with a shortcode, to enter in the post. The shortcode is displayed in the list of Responsive Slider
